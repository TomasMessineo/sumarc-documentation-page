# Version 1.0

*   **TCPDF Engine:** Uses the TCPDF library for document generation.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** Design selection is handled via PHP classes using the Strategy pattern.
*   **Programmatic Renderers:** PDF elements (titles, authors) are printed using specific "Renderer" classes written in PHP.
*   **High Complexity:** Adding a new template requires creating and registering separate PHP classes for each component (Header, Body, Footer) and integrating them into the plugin code.
