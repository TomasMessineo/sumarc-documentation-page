# Version 1.0

**Initial Release with APA 7 Support**
This version incorporates a fundamental improvement over the original plugin: the ability to automatically identify and structure bibliographic references.

## Key Features

*   **DOCX to JATS Conversion**: Core functionality for converting structure, paragraphs, tables, and figures.
*   **Reference Identification (APA 7)**:
    *   Implementation of a new `citation-parser` submodule based on regular expressions.
    *   Ability to extract authors, year, title, source, and DOI/URL from plain text references formatted in APA 7.
    *   Automatic generation of structured `<ref-list>` and `<element-citation>` tags, replacing the mixed citations (`<mixed-citation>`) of the original development.
*   **Integration with docxToJats**: The citation parser is injected into the `docxToJats` conversion flow, processing the bibliography section detected in the document.
