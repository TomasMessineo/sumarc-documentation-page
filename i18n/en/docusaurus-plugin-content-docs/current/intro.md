# Introduction to SUMARC

SUMARC is a tool developed at UNLP (National University of La Plata) designed to manage and process academic documents, facilitating their conversion, editing, and publication.

Its main objective is to modernize and standardize the editorial workflow, allowing the transformation of documents from common formats (like DOCX) to international standards like **JATS XML**, and subsequently to final reading formats like PDF and HTML.

## Main Features

SUMARC integrates several specialized plugins that work together to offer a complete solution:

*   **Conversion:** Transformation of DOCX documents to JATS XML.
*   **Editing:** Visualization and editing of JATS XML content through a user-friendly interface.
*   **Generation:** Automatic creation of PDF and HTML versions from the XML.
*   **Enrichment:** Improvement of XML metadata with **XMLMetadataBuilder**.
*   **Adaptation:** Compatibility with specific standards such as those of SciELO.

## Key Benefits

Using SUMARC provides significant advantages for editorial teams:

*   **Interoperability:** Ensures documents comply with international digital preservation standards.
*   **Efficiency:** Automates repetitive formatting and conversion tasks, reducing publication time.
*   **Accessibility:** Facilitates the generation of accessible formats like HTML and structured PDF.

In this documentation, we will explore each of these components in detail and how they interact with each other.
