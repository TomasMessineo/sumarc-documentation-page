# Version 2.0

This version introduces an architectural change compared to version 1.0 for greater flexibility and ease of use.

*   **New Rendering Engine (mPDF + Smarty):** Migrated from TCPDF to mPDF integrated with Smarty template engine.
*   **Dynamic Templates:** Now uses `.tpl` files (HTML + Smarty) and CSS. This allows manipulating the PDF structure as if it were a web page, greatly simplifying design work.
*   **Catalog System:** The PDF structure is defined declaratively in a `catalog.xml` file, decoupling visual configuration from PHP logic.
*   **Ease of Editing:** It is no longer necessary to program PHP classes for each part of the PDF; simply editing the template files (HTML/CSS) is sufficient.
