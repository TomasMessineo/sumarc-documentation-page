# Texture

**Texture** is the visual WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor integrated into SUMARC for direct manipulation of JATS XML files within the OJS workflow.

## Main Function
Allows editors and authors to correct and refine the semantic content of an article without needing to edit XML code directly. Texture presents the document as a traditional manuscript but maintains the JATS structure underneath.

## Workflow
1.  In the **Production** stage of OJS, you must have a JATS XML file (usually previously generated by DocxConverter).
2.  Clicking edit opens the Texture interface.
3.  The user makes visual changes (correct text, adjust figures, edit citations).
4.  Upon saving, Texture updates the XML file on the server.

## Supported JATS Tags (Selection)
Texture supports a robust subset of JATS tags essential for scientific publications:

| Element | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `p` | Paragraphs of text. | ✅ |
| `sec` | Sections and subsections with headings. | ✅ |
| `list` | Ordered and unordered lists. | ✅ |
| `fig` / `graphic` | Figures and images. | ✅ |
| `table-wrap` | Complex tables. | ✅ |
| `disp-quote` | Highlighted block quotes. | ✅ |
| `disp-formula` / `tex-math` | Mathematical equations (LaTeX). | ✅ |
| `code` | Code blocks. | ✅ |

### Not Supported
Some very specific elements like chemical structures (`chem-struct-wrap`) or multimedia (`media`) may not have direct visual representation or editing support.

## Image Handling
For images to be visualized in Texture:
1.  They must be uploaded as **dependent files** in OJS in the same stage as the XML.
2.  Texture will link them automatically if the references in the XML match.

## Advanced Guide
For developers who need to extend Texture functionalities (add new fields, roles, etc.), see the [Modification Guide](modification-guide.md).
